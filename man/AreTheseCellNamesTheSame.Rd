  min.overlap = 0.33
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec1}{Character vector, eg. with cell names}

\item{vec2}{Character vector, eg. with cell names}

\item{names}{Names for plotting}

\item{min.overlap}{Threhold below there is no there is no meaninful overlap between the tow vectors. The function aborts with an error.}
}
\description{
Compare two character vectors (e.g.: cell IDs) how much they overlap and plot a Venn Diagram.
