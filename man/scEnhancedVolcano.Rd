\arguments{
\item{toptable}{A data frame with the results of differential gene expression analysis.}

\item{x}{The x-axis, which is typically the average log2 fold change.}

\item{y}{The y-axis, which is typically the adjusted p-value.}

\item{lab}{A vector of gene symbols to label on the plot.}

\item{title}{The title of the plot.}

\item{selectLab}{A vector of gene symbols to select for labeling.}

\item{min.p}{The minimum p-value, to trim high values on the Y-axis.}

\item{max.l2fc}{The maximum log2 fold change, to trim high values on the X-axis.}

\item{min.pct.cells}{The minimum percentage of cells in which a gene must be expressed to be included in the plot.}

\item{pCutoffCol}{The column in the toptable that contains the p-value cutoff.}

\item{pCutoff}{The p-value cutoff.}

\item{FCcutoff}{The fold change cutoff.}

\item{suffix}{A string to append to the filename/title of the plot.}

\item{caption}{The first line of caption of the plot.}

\item{caption2}{The second line of caption of the plot.}

\item{count_stats}{Logical. Calculates a data frame with the count statistics.}

\item{drawConnectors}{Whether to draw connectors between the labels and the points.}

\item{max.overlaps}{The maximum number of labels that can overlap.}

\item{h}{The height of the plot.}

\item{w}{The width of the plot.}

\item{...}{Pass any other parameter to \code{EnhancedVolcano::EnhancedVolcano()}.}
