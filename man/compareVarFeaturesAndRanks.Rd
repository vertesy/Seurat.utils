\title{Compare variable features and their ranks in two Seurat objects.}
\usage{
compareVarFeaturesAndRanks(obj1 = NULL, obj2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj1}{The first Seurat object for comparison. Default: NULL.}

\item{obj2}{The second Seurat object for comparison. Default: NULL.}
}
\value{
A list containing the common genes and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
}
\description{
This function compares variable features (genes) between two Seurat objects,
reporting the number of genes in each, the percentage of common genes, the percentage
of unique genes in each object, and the similarity in the ranking of overlapping genes
using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The function returns the common genes
and the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
}
\examples{
# Assuming obj1 and obj2 are Seurat objects
result <- compareVarFeaturesAndRanks(obj1, obj2)
}
